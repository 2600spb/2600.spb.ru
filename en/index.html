      <p>2600 Meetings exist as a forum for all interested in technology to meet and talk about events in technology-land, learn, and teach. Meetings are open to anyone of any age or level of expertise.</p>
      <p>We meet in a public area. Nobody is excluded. There is no admission charge or dues of any sort. It's preferable to have meetings in as open a spot as possible rather than behind closed doors. This ensures that new people who don't know about the meetings will be drawn in. We have nothing to hide and we don't presume to judge who is worthy of attending and who is not. We act in a responsible manner. We don't do illegal things and we don't cause problems for the place we're meeting in. Most 2600 meetings are welcomed by the establishments we choose.</p>
      <p>We meet on the first Friday of the month between 7 pm and 11 pm local time</p>
